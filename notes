Inversion of Control
If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.

Inversion of Control can be achieved through various mechanisms such as:
Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).

IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code.

example
	creditCard demo, isValid(), strategy pattern


Dependency Injection
In case of Field-Based DI, we can inject the dependencies by marking them with an @Autowired annotation:

public class Store {
    @Autowired
    private Item item;
}


Fragility:
Tendency of the sw to break in many places everytime when it is changed
